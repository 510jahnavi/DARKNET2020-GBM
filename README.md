# DARKNET2020-GBM
This is my Information System Analysis and Audit Project. I will be performing Network Intrusion Detection on Darknet 2020 dataset using Gradient Boosting Classifier

About the Dataset:

In CICDarknet2020 dataset, a two-layered approach is used to generate benign and darknet traffic at the first layer. The darknet traffic constitutes Audio-Stream, Browsing, Chat, Email, P2P, Transfer, Video-Stream and VOIP which is generated at the second layer. To generate the representative dataset, previously generated datasets, namely, ISCXTor2016 and ISCXVPN2016, have been amalgamated and respective VPN and Tor traffic are combined in corresponding Darknet categories.

No. of rows: 1.4 Lacs approx..
No. of columns: 85
